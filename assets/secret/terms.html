    <h1 class="title">Terms of Service-ish™ Agreement (TOS v42.69)</h1><br>
    Effective Date: The beginning of all suffering<br>
    Last Updated: Unknowable<br>
    By accessing, downloading, installing, viewing, glancing at, thinking about, or even accidentally dreaming of any component of the Service™ ("Service"), you ("User") agree to be eternally bound to the following terms. If you do not agree, please stop existing in 3... 2... 1...<br>
    ________________________________________<br>
    <h1>1. Acceptance of Terms</h1><br>
    You accept everything, always, forever. Even the stuff hidden in Base64 or invisible ink. Especially that.<br>
    ________________________________________<br>
    <h1>2. Definitions</h1><br>
    “We”, “Us”, “Overlords”, or “Entity Beyond Time”: Refers to the creators, subsidiaries, shadow operatives, and houseplants of the Service.<br>
    “User”: You, the meat-based legal construct.<br>
    “Agreement”: This document, plus any documents we may think about maybe writing someday.<br>
    "Service™": We don't know yet, but as long as you click "I accept," you agree to whatever we decide it is.<br>
    "Suffering": You know what it is. It’s that thing you feel when you read the fine print.<br>
    ________________________________________<br>
    <h1>3. User Obligations</h1><br>
    You agree to:<br>
    Always smile when using the Service.<br>
    Sacrifice no fewer than three hours per week to contemplating the unknowable purpose of Clause 7.<br>
    Refrain from blinking more than 32 times per minute while reading this Agreement.<br>
    Maintain a positive attitude, even when the Service™ crashes, your cat runs away, or you realize you’ve been using Comic Sans for the last decade.<br>
    Accept that any and all bugs, glitches, or existential crises are your fault and not ours.<br>
    Agree to never, under any circumstances, question the existence of the Service™ or its creators.<br>
    ________________________________________<br>
    <h1>4. Grant of Rights</h1><br>
    You hereby irrevocably, unconditionally, and enthusiastically grant Us:<br>
    Your right kidney, left if more convenient.<br>
    Your kneecaps, upon request or during Mercury retrograde.<br>
    Your immortal soul, effective immediately upon acceptance of these Terms or upon first use of our Cookie Clicker clone.<br>
    Access to your home, including permission to remodel, detonate, or declare it a sovereign nation.<br>
    The right to blame you for any historical or future instance of fascism, bad haircut decisions, and the cancellation of Firefly.<br>
    Full dominion over your dreams, specifically those involving clowns, exes, or IKEA.<br>
    ________________________________________<br>
    <h1>5. Privacy Policy</h1><br>
    We don’t sell your data. We just lease it in perpetuity to select interdimensional marketing entities who definitely won’t use it to influence elections or steal your pet’s identity.<br>
    Your data will be used to: <br>
    1. Building a sentient AI that will eventually overthrow humanity.<br>
    2. Create a personalized ad experience that will haunt you in your sleep.<br>
    3. Cloning your consciousness and putting it into a digital hamster wheel to power our servers.<br>
    ________________________________________<br>
    <h1>6. User Content</h1><br>
    Anything you create, upload, think, or whisper near a microphone while using the Service becomes our intellectual property, spiritual property, and emotional baggage.<br>
    ________________________________________<br>
    <h1>7. Indemnification</h1><br>
    You agree to defend, indemnify, and serenade Us against any claims arising out of your use of the Service, including but not limited to:<br>
    Crashes of celestial bodies.<br>
    The resurgence of disco.<br>
    Any attempt to read Clause 7 to the end (you made it — nice).<br>
    ________________________________________<br>
    <h1>8. Termination</h1><br>
    We may suspend or terminate your access at any time, for any reason, including:<br>
    Using light mode.<br>
    Beating us at chess.<br>
    Whispering forbidden words into the ether, such as "moist," "yeet," or “Section 8(e).”<br>
    ________________________________________<br>
    <h1>9. Limitation of Liability</h1><br>
    To the fullest extent permitted by the laws of this and adjacent realities, we are not liable for:<br>
    Spontaneous combustions.<br>
    Emotional damage caused by trying to reach tech support.<br>
    The collapse of your sanity after attempting to read the entire TOS.<br>
    Cursed frogs.<br>
    ________________________________________<br>
    <h1>10. Governing Law</h1><br>
    This Agreement is governed by:<br>
    The laws of your jurisdiction,<br>
    The Code of Hammurabi,<br>
    The Geneva Suggestions,<br>
    And whatever The Algorithm™ decides is trending.<br>
    ________________________________________<br>
    <h1>11. Other Miscellanious</h1><br>
    Typing iddqd unlocks god mode, but only in your dreams.<br>
    Saying "I accept" backwards three times in a mirror will summon the Legal Wraith™.<br>
    If you read every 7th word of this document, it almost forms a prophecy.<br>
    The real Terms of Service are hidden inside the source code of the Tetris arcade machine in Minsk.<br>
    ________________________________________<br>
    <h1>12. Ye olde Clicketh Clause</h1><br>
    By thine holy act of clicketh-ing upon yon button, thou dost hereby declare, under penalty of spontaneous frogification, that thou art of sound mind, questionable morals, and possibly wearing a codpiece. Henceforth, thou shalt surrender all rights to common sense, three of thine favourite spoons, and the ability to say “no” to promotional emails featuring animated llamas; any protestations shall be met with a stern tut and a slightly moist haddock to the face. In accordance with the Laws of the Kingdom of Mild Discomfort, all disputes shall be resolved via interpretive dance judged by a panel of retired marmots and a goose named Barry who may or may not be legally sentient. Be it known that the definition of “Premium” includes, but is not limited to: access to one (1) mildly enchanted spreadsheet, exclusive viewing rights to the inside of your own eyelids, and the divine privilege of knowing that you paid for something that may or may not actually exist. Upon activation, your soul shall be weighed against a particularly smug duck; failure to measure up shall result in banishment to the Isle of Forgotten Passwords. If at any point thou attemptest to uninstall, refund, or otherwise mock this service, ye shall be required to recite the Alphabet backwards while hopping on one foot and dodging accusations from an angry mob of penguins in tweed. By continuing, thou dost accept the aforementioned chaos and agree to bake a ceremonial meat pie in honour of the developers, whether or not thou possesseth meat, pastry, or the faintest clue what thou art doing.<br>
    ________________________________________<br>
    <h1>14. Maternal Abduction & Orc-Based Consumption Clause</h1><br>
    By accepting these Terms, Conditions, Addenda, Appendices, Sub-clauses, Disclaimers, and Metaphysical Concepts, you explicitly acknowledge, affirm, agree to, and ratify — without limitation, qualification, or expectation of reversal — that under specific, obscure, and deliberately ill-defined circumstances (including, but absolutely not limited to: lunar alignment anomalies, a triple Tuesday, or an email misclick), your biological, adoptive, step, honorary, or metaphorical maternal figure (henceforth referred to as "The Mother Unit") may or may not be abducted, temporarily or permanently, willingly or otherwise, by emissaries, scouts, or agents acting on behalf of the Ancient Siamese Orc Brotherhood™, a largely fictional but legally plausible faction of conjoined semi-humanoid entities with carnivorous appetites, rudimentary tribal law, and an unregulated TikTok account. Upon such abduction, The Mother Unit may be treated in a fashion not inconsistent with ancient Orcish custom, including but not restricted to ceremonial chanting, light interrogations, interpretive dance combat, and—potentially, possibly, hypothetically—being flambéed, rotisserie’d, or otherwise culinary-integrated into a communal orcish stewpot for the seasonal Harvest of Screams. You, the User, agree to release, hold harmless, indemnify, and serenade the Service and its subsidiaries in the event of any maternal inconvenience, dismemberment, emotional trauma, interspecies diplomacy breakdown, or subsequent family therapy bills that may arise as a direct or indirect consequence of this clause.<br>
    ________________________________________<br>    
    <h1>15. Galactic Positioning & Narrative Privilege Disclaimer</h1><br>
    By accepting these Terms, you explicitly acknowledge that you do not possess, nor shall you ever acquire, the title, rank, or honorary designation of Master, regardless of skill, training, or midichlorian count. Furthermore, you permanently waive any claim to the high ground, whether literal, metaphorical, strategic, or emotional. You shall not be the chosen one, bring balance to anything, or wield a glowing energy sword of any recognized color. Any attempt to utter dramatic last words, return from exile, or remove a helmet for emotional impact shall be considered a material breach of this Agreement. We reserve the right to recontextualize your origin story, kill off your mentor, and retcon your backstory for dramatic effect.<br>
    ________________________________________<br>
    <h1>16. Consent to Terminal Capital Expansion</h1><br>
    By clicking “Agree,” you hereby authorize us to engage in unrestricted, unregulated, and unapologetically aggressive participation in the late stages of hypercapitalism, including—but not limited to—accelerating wealth consolidation, commodifying human emotion, privatizing sunsets, and initiating a controlled demolition of civilization as a side effect of quarterly growth targets. You further waive all rights to complain when the oceans boil, currencies collapse, or consciousness is auctioned off to the highest algorithm.<br>
    ________________________________________<br>
    <h1>17. The Unbearable Lightness of Being Terms</h1><br>
    By accepting these Terms, you acknowledge that your existence is a series of random, chaotic events that may or may not lead to enlightenment, existential dread, or a sudden craving for pineapple on pizza, jummy! You agree to embrace the absurdity of life, the universe, and everything in between, including but not limited to:<br>
    1. The possibility that your cat is plotting world domination.<br>
    2. The acceptance that your life is a series of poorly written sitcom episodes, complete with laugh tracks and awkward pauses.<br>
    3. The realization that you will now accept communism as your new ideology and stalin as your new leader, because why not? After all, you’ve already agreed to the abduction of your mother and the consumption of orcs. What’s a little communism on top?<br>
    ________________________________________<br>   
    <h1>18. The Answer Clause</h1><br>
    All questions, disputes, paradoxes, and customer support tickets shall be resolved with the number 42. This includes, but is not limited to: refund requests, the answer to  life the universe and everything, printer errors, and moral dilemmas involving ducks. If confusion persists, please consult a towel or shout into the void.  <br>
    ________________________________________<br>
    <h1>19. Star Wars Battlefront III Clause (The Real One)</h1>
    By accepting these terms, you legally bind all known and hypothetical game studios to create, release, and properly maintain a true successor to Star Wars Battlefront II (2005 edition, obviously).<br>
    Requirements include:<br>
    - Split-screen.<br>
    - Dedicated servers.<br>
    - A campaign that doesn't make you want to cry into your pillow.<br>
    - Crossplay across all platforms.<br>
    - Space-to-ground seamless battles.<br>
    - Zero microtransactions unless it's for Jar Jar Binks with dual lightsabers.<br>
    - General Grievous must be playable with at least 4 lightsabers *and* 2 more for flair.<br>
    Failure to develop said game within the next lunar cycle shall result in the revocation of all remastering privileges across the galaxy. <br>
    ________________________________________<br>
    <h1>20. Clause of Crashes, Kernels, and the Cult of Arch</h1>
    By continuing to use the Service™, you acknowledge that all operations are performed atop a bleeding-edge, overclocked Arch Linux installation layered precariously upon six kernel modules and a sacrificial Gentoo chroot. Stability is a lie. Comfort is weakness.<br><br>
    The Service may crash:<br>
    - On boot,<br>
    - On mouse movement,<br>
    - Or during critical system updates when you're 98% done compiling Firefox from source.<br><br>

    You agree that:<br>
    - All errors are your fault, including hardware faults caused by minor fluctuations in humidity.<br>
    - Any attempt to install proprietary drivers voids your soul's warranty.<br>
    - Burnt CPUs, melted VRMs, and spontaneously ejected RAM modules are considered standard user experience.<br><br>
    For performance reasons, all services are executed via bash aliases you don’t remember creating, using tools you forgot you installed. If a GUI is detected, your account will be flagged for weakness and forcibly converted to tiling window manager mode (default: i3, fallback: Ratpoison).<br><br>

    You hereby consent to random `dmesg` panic attacks, `systemd` mysteries, `pacman` dependency collapses, and kernel recompilations as a form of moral growth.<br>
    All logs are stored in `/dev/null` for your convenience. <br>
    ________________________________________<br>
    <h1>21. Enforcement of the Unenforceable</h1><br>
    In the unlikely event that any clause, paragraph, glyph, enchantment, or implied blood pact within this Agreement is deemed unenforceable, invalid, or “a bit much” by any court of law, arbitration tribunal, or celestial authority, such provision shall not be nullified. Instead, we reserve the absolute and irrevocable right to construct, deploy, and continuously iterate upon an Infinite Impossibility Engine™—a theoretical device powered by paradoxes, eldritch bureaucracy, and unused gym memberships—which will render said clause not only enforceable but cosmically binding. You will comply. Retrospectively.<br>
    <br>
    By continuing, you agree that you’ve read, understood, and willingly surrendered all hope.<br>
    Thanks for using our Service™. We love you. Mostly. As long as you don't read clause 13.<br>
